<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This documentation was built with beginners in mind, but has the necessary information for more seasoned producers.</p>

<p>To install and use Ed you will be using your terminal. If you need a refresher, I highly recommend “<a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">The Command Line Crash Course</a>.” Working knowledge of HTML and CSS is also taken for granted. If you’re new to HTML and CSS, you may want to check out the relevant courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">codecademy.com</a>.</p>

<p>Jekyll does not run very well on Windows machines as of now. If you are using Windows, this theme won’t work for you, but we hope that you simply deploy our principles on a system like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which does work on Windows.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="installing-ed-easy">Installing Ed: Easy</h2>

<p>The easy way to do this is not necessarily the more robust, and may simply not work on your system. The easy way could also be called the ‘lucky’ way. It will work if your system is ready for Ed. Two major caveats to keep in mind if you go the easy route: a) You may run into problems later when some Ed components need updating; and, b) You may run into conflicts if you run several Ruby environments for different projects. That said, if you just want to quickly try Ed, and you don’t run into problems installing, this is perhaps the best approach.</p>

<p>Open your terminal. Install the software needed to run Jekyll using the following commands:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>gem install jekyll
<span class="gp">$ </span>gem install jekyll-scholar
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using the terminal’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, switch to the directory where you want to install your project. Once inside the folder, you are ready to download and start using Ed:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/elotroalex/ed.git
<span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>ed
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’s it. If at any point during this process you had an error you could not resolve, move on to the next section.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="installing-ed-robust">Installing Ed: Robust</h2>

<p>The first step to install Ed is to download the source files from GitHub. To do so you must have git installed on your computer. You probably have git already, but if you don’t, here are <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">some great instructions</a> to get you started. Mac users may want to ensure they have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> and its command line tools installed. To check if git is running on your system enter the following line on your terminal (remember to ignore the $):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git --version
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you don’t get an error, you’re good to go. Using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command on your terminal, navigate to the folder where you keep your web projects. Once you’re in the folder where you want Ed to live, download it from github using the following line (remember you can copy and paste):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/elotroalex/ed.git
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point you should navigate inside your Ed project folder and stay there until further notice:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>ed
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Jekyll is a Ruby gem (Ruby’s name for software packages). Besides Jekyll, Ed needs another gem to run: jekyll-scholar. I have provided a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> that allows you to install the versions of jekyll and jekyll-scholar that I used to create Ed. Before you can use this <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>, you need to setup the right Ruby environment for Ed to run smoothly. The best way to ensure you have the right environment is to use Ruby Version Manager, or <a href="https://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, and the latest stable version of Ruby. To install rvm <em>and</em> a recent version of Ruby at the same time, enter the following two lines into your terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

<span class="gp">$ </span><span class="se">\c</span>url -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After the process runs succesfully, read the last few lines generated by the terminal. You will see final instructions for making rvm run. Once you finish the process, check to see if rvm is running by entering:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>rvm --version
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you don’t get an error, you’re ready for the next step. If you do get an error, and don’t feel comfortable troubleshooting on the terminal, this is a good opportunity to reach out to a friend who can help. If you’re comfortable troubleshooting, I recommend Jekyll’s own <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/">troubleshooting documentation</a>. Another great strategy for troubleshooting on the terminal is to copy and paste the errors you receive (sans personal information) into your favorite search engine.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a gemset for your jekyll projects. A gemset is a set of gems. If you don’t create and use a gemset, every gem you install will be applied system-wide. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you will have several projects with several setups, this strategy will serve you well in the long run. To create a gemset:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>rvm gemset create edgems
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To use the gemset you just created:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>rvm gemset use edgems
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>N.B. Everytime you open a new tab on your terminal, you will need to declare the gemset you want to use, or else it will revert to <code class="highlighter-rouge">(default)</code>.</p>

<p>Now that rvm and Ruby are set up, we’re ready to install our first gem: Bundler. Bundler is a gem that allows you to install many gems at the same time using Gemfiles, which is a simple list of specific gems that lives in your project folder. Once you install it, you will be ready to run the Gemfile I provided in the source files. To install Bundler:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>gem install bundler
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you ran into problems following these instructions so far, you should try a more detailed walkthrough. Here’s <a href="https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/ruby-rvm-gemsets-and-bundlergemfiles">a great tutorial</a> on how to do both rvm and Bundler from Rob Decker.</p>

<p>You’re very close. Now that Bundler is installed, the final step is to install the gems we will need to run Ed: jekyll and jekyll-scholar. To do so run the Gemfile this way (remember you must be inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ed</code> folder for this to work):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>bundle install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>N.B. Everytime you open a new tab on your terminal, besides declaring your gemset, you will need to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> if you want jekyll to work on that terminal tab.</p>

<p>If you don’t get any errors, Ed should work at this point. To see if Ed is working properly we will take advantage of Jekyll’s built in server. You can build the first version of your site and run the jekyll server at the same time by entering:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll serve
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you are running multiple Ruby environments, you can simplify your life by removing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle exec</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Copy the url from your terminal log and paste it into your browser of choice (I recommend Firefox). This url usually looks something like this <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</code>. At this point you should be looking at your very own working version of Ed:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/screenshot-home.png" alt="Your very own Ed" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h2>

<p>Ed is a Jekyll theme. That means you will need some familiarity with Jekyll to take advantage of its full potential. While running a Jekyll site is a bit more involved than Wordpress and other similar tools, the payoff in the long term is worth the effort to learn it. If you are new to Jekyll, I recommend you take a look at <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/jekyll1/60913">“How (and Why) to Generate a Static Website Using Jekyll”</a> at ProfHacker, and the excellent <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll documentation</a> to start getting a sense of how it works.</p>

<p>Once you have gone through these tutorials, you can get started using Ed by replacing the sample texts included in in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> folder in Ed with your own texts. Remember to always and only edit files in Ed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">a plain text editor</a>, and <em>not</em> a word processor. I’m composing this file using a plain text editor called <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.</p>

<p>An easy way to make new texts is to copy an existing text, replace the content and rename the file. Remember to always use the jekyll convention for naming posts <code class="highlighter-rouge">yyyy-mm-dd-short-title.md</code>. You should also make sure that all your texts have the YAML front matter (the information at the top of the file). YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”—no disrespect to XML—and it’s the main way that Jekyll handles named data. Here’s an example of YAML front matter:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">poem</span>
<span class="s">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Cahier</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">d'un</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">retour</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">au</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">pays</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">natal"</span>
<span class="s">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Aimé Césaire</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Besides replacing content and creating new texts, you will probably  want to edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file to replace the boilerplate information we provided with your own personalized information in the relevant categories. Avoid replacing the information in categories that are not clear to you. Make sure to use proper YAML formatting when writing in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. Here’s <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html">a good reference source</a> in case you have doubts.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="markdown-and-kramdown">Markdown and kramdown</h2>

<p>Ed is designed for scholars and amateur editors who want to produce either a clean reading edition or a scholarly annotated edition of a text. The main language we use to write in the Jekyll environment is called Markdown. To learn more about the Markdown family, see Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff’s “<a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown</a>.”</p>

<p>Our version of Jekyll uses a special Markdown processor called kramdown. The processor can be said to use it’s own ‘flavor’ of Markdown, and sometimes the Markdown syntax will be different than other flavors of Markdown. Kramdown is convenient for scholars because of the way it handles footnotes. You can become familiar with the kramdown syntax in the <a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html">kramdown documentation</a>. Another way to become familiar is to examine the sample text source files we provided.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="genres">Genres</h2>

<p>Ed offers three different layouts: poem, narrative and drama. The genre is indicated in the YAML front matter on your texts. Using these layouts will allow you to tweak the stylesheets according to your different needs. Out of the box, Ed contains some special instructions for poetry in it’s stylesheets that allow you to deal with some of the peculiarities of poetry layouts.</p>

<p>To indicate lines in poetry we use the line syntax from Markdown:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> Hold fast to dreams
<span class="p">-</span> For if dreams die
<span class="p">-</span> Life is a broken-winged bird
<span class="p">-</span> That cannot fly.
<span class="p">-</span> Hold fast to dreams
<span class="p">-</span> For when dreams go
<span class="p">-</span> Life is a barren field
<span class="p">-</span> Frozen with snow.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To indent specific lines we take advantage of a feature in kramdown that allows us to indicate classes for a line. This approach still allows the line to be readable while editing.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">-</span> {:.indent-3} But O heart! heart! heart!
<span class="p">-</span> {:.indent-4} O the bleeding drops of red,
<span class="p">-</span> {:.indent-5} Where on the deck my Captain lies,
<span class="p">-</span> {:.indent-6} Fallen cold and dead.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code> at the beginning of each line indicates that these are lines. The <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">:.indent-3</span><span class="p">}</span></code> is what we need to in order to indicate the indent value for that line. Values can range from 1-10. You can expand the range or adjust the values in the CSS stylesheet in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code> folder.</p>

<p>The example from Raisin in the Sun shows us that we don’t need much special markup for theater as long as we use CAPITAL LETTERS for speakers. Italics for directions are easy enough. Just use <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> around the words you want to italicize.</p>

<p><em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em> shows us an example of narrative that includes footnotes and quoted poetry. See the sections below for how to accomplish these different effects. A future release may include a special sidebar for a long narrative table of contents.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="kramdown-and-html">Kramdown and HTML</h2>

<p>For more hand-crafted layouts—<a href="/toc/narrative.html#title-page">the title page in <em>Narrative of the Life</em></a>, for example—you may choose to work directly with HTML. One of the great advantages of working with kramdown is that we have a lot of flexibility to mix HTML with the kramdown syntax. Here is the code for the title page of <em>Narrative of the Life</em>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"title-page"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"centered large"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>NARRATIVE<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>OF THE<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>LIFE<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>OF<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"centered larger"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>FREDERICK DOUGLASS<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"centered large"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>AN<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>AMERICAN SLAVE.<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"centered"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>BOSTON<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"centered"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>PUBLISHED AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE,<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>NO. 25 CORNHILL<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>1845<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"centered small"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>ENTERED, ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS,<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>IN THE YEAR 1845<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>BY FREDERICK DOUGLASS,<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT COURT<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>OF MASSACHUSETTS.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The effects of this page can be achieved with kramdown syntax, but I chose to use HTML to demonstrate its use and to highlight the presence of size and center classes in the stylesheet.</p>

<p>A note on line breaks: The use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code> here bears further commenting. In many cases we need to insert and HTML break because kramdown has the tendency to ignore hard breaks. Feel free to use them whenever you see that the breaks you want are ignored.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<p>Footnotes are the bread and butter of scholarship. Kramdown makes footnotes a fairly simple affair:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; 
- Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle[^fn2] trills,

...

[^fn2]: The bugle is a small trumpet implicated in the military industrial complex.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These footnotes can be placed anywhere, but they will always be generated at the bottom of the document. To have a multi-paragraph footnote you need to start the footnote text on the next line after the footnote anchor and indent it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[^fn3]:
	Ugh pinterest fixie cronut pitchfork beard. Literally deep 
	cold-pressed distillery pabst austin. 

	Typewriter 90's roof party poutine, kickstarter raw 
	denim pabst readymade biodiesel umami chicharrones XOXO. 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The footnotes system provided by kramdown does have one limitation: It generates the numeration for you automatically, and it only allows you to have one set of footnotes for a text. In some cases we have to separate the author’s footnotes from our own, in others we want to represent the author’s own footnote style. In these cases we have to use HTML. Here’s the example from <em>Narrative of the Life</em>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>... At this time, Anna,<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#fn2"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"ref2"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>\*<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</span> my intended wife, came on;

...

<span class="nt">&lt;sup</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"fn2"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>*<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span> She was free. [<span class="ni">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</span>](#ref2)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice the double HTML Entity (hex), <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</code>, used at the end of the footnote to return us to the top. The first hex is the ↩︎ symbol proper. The second assigns the proper variant glyph. This is a necessary hack while we wait for Apple devices to stop turning everything into unseemly emojis.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h2>

<p><em>Narrative of the Life</em> also includes several blockquotes. You can also find another example of blockquote use in the footnote of “O Captain! My Captain!” Simple blockquotes are simple enough in kramdown:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my servant, full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays.
&gt;
&gt; Written with mine own hand, &amp;c., 1835.  
&gt; WILLIAM HAMILTON,
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To use a line break in block elements add two spaces after the end of the line where you want the break. You can’t see them after <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;c., 1835.</code> but they are there.</p>

<p>Things get a bit complicated when we want to use poetry inside the block or when the block is included in another block element, like a footnote. Here’s the last two stanzas from “A Parody” in <em>Narrative of the Life</em>, which shows an example of a blockquote of poetry:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
&gt; - Two others oped their iron jaws,
&gt; - And waved their children-stealing paws;
&gt; - There sat their children in gewgaws;
&gt; - By stinting negroes' backs and maws,
&gt; - They kept up heavenly union.
&gt; ^
&gt; - All good from Jack another takes,
&gt; - And entertains their flirts and rakes,
&gt; - Who dress as sleek as glossy snakes,
&gt; - And cram their mouths with sweetened cakes;
&gt; - And this goes down for union.
{:.poetry}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">:.poetry</span><span class="p">}</span></code> tag at the end tells the processor to think of the lines above it as poetry. The <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">:.poetry</span><span class="p">}</span></code> tag is an example of kramdown class assignments for block-elements. Because this segment of poetry exists in the ‘narrative’ layout, and because it is part of a blockquote, we need to signal to the processor to process poetry this way, so that the right class is invoked in the stylesheet. Notice also the <code class="highlighter-rouge">^</code> separating the stanzas. This bit of kramdown syntax helps us separate the stanzas while staying within the blockquote. The good news is this is the most complex kramdown syntax layout you will encounter in Ed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bibliographies">Bibliographies</h2>

<p>To help us style and generate bibliographies and citations, Ed uses the jekyll-scholar gem by <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/">Sylvester Keil</a>. To learn more about how to use the gem, make sure to read the documentation on the <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">jekyll-scholar</a> GitHub page.</p>

<p>Pro tip: I recommend you use <a href="http://zotero.org/">Zotero</a> to keep track of your bibliography for your project. This will make it easy for you to generate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">reference.bib</code> (a BibLaTeX file) you will need to make jekyll-scholar work with Ed. To export from Zotero in this format all you need is to select the references you need, right click and select <code class="highlighter-rouge">export in...</code> and choose the BibLaTeX format. Rename your file to reference.bib and move it into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_bibliography</code> folder.</p>

<p>Because we are more likely than not to use citations in footnotes or pages that contain footnotes, and because footnotes will be necessarily generated at the bottom of the page, Ed uses a separate page for your Bibliography or works cited. The page is provided for you as a page, and uses the default page layout. Notice that the bibliography itself is generated by a liquid tag:</p>

<pre>
&#123;% bibliography %&#125;
</pre>

<p>If you want your inline citations to link to the bibliography page, instead of writing them by hand, you can use the cite function in jekyll-scholar. In order to point to the bibliography page we need to take advantage of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--relative</code> flag in jekyll-scholar:</p>

<pre>
&#123;% cite cesaire_discourse_2001 -r /bibliography.html %&#125;
</pre>

<p>This code generates the citation in <a href="/toc/o-captain.html#fn:fn3">footnote #3</a> in “O Captain! My Captain!.” Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cite</code> is the jekyllscholar command.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cesaire_discourse_2001</code> is the unique ID for Césaire’s Discours on Colonialism included in the reference.bib file.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code> is short for <code class="highlighter-rouge">--relative</code>, a flag signalling jekyll-scholar that we’re about to provide it with a relative link path.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/bibliography.html</code>, the relative path of our bibliography.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bibliographies may be optional to you. If you will not need a bibliography, or your bibliography is small enough that you feel it would be easier to write it out directly, you may want to consider not using the jekyll-scholar gem at all. If this is the case, feel free to erase the gem from the Gemfile, or avoid installing it directly. For Ed to run without jekyll-scholar you need to also erase the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bibliography.html</code> page, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_bibliography</code> folder, and the citation in footnote 3 in the “O Captain! My Captain” sample text. Jekyll should build normally after that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>

<p>Your editions are treated as posts in Ed. Other pages exist outside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> folder. The homepage, for example, is constructed from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file found on the root folder of your Ed project.</p>

<p>You will notice that the homepage in particular has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.html</code> file ending instead of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> ending. Although the file is indeed an HTML file, notice that it still contains YAML front matter and liquid tags. To edit the homepage replace the content on the file shipped with Ed, making sure that your changes to <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> are written in valid HTML.</p>

<p>Besides the homepage, Ed ships with an About page, <code class="highlighter-rouge">about.md</code> and a Bibliography page, <code class="highlighter-rouge">bibliography.md</code>. As you can see, these are regular <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files. You can replace the contents of each file using normal kramdown syntax. This also applies to any new page you create, which you should remember to save with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> extension. When editing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bibliography.md</code> file, be careful not to replace the liquid tag that generates your bibliography, unless you don’t want to have a bibliography at all.</p>

  <li>The Table of Contents is produced automatically for all texts with the category ‘toc’. To create your own table of contents make sure to include the <code class="highlighter-rouge">categories: toc</code> in your YAML front matter.</li>
  <li>The folding sidebar menu is generated from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sidebar.html</code> file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folder. The top menu items are generated automatically from your pages. The bottom menu items are manually written in HTML. This structure can allow you to add external links. If you don’t have that many pages, you may choose to do all the links by hand.</li>
  <li>Make sure to add horizontal rules, <code class="highlighter-rouge">---</code>, to separate sections in your texts. This creates a more pleasant layout.</li>
  <li>You can clean unnecessary folders and files from the original Ed package before publishing your site. This will help you reduce overhead. For example, you can erase this page, the sample texts and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">syntax.css</code> file (used for styling code).</li>
  <li>Consider providing tips for your readers on how to make their font bigger or smaller by taking advantage of <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd>; or to leverage the power of Google’s <a href="https://moz.com/blog/25-killer-combos-for-googles-site-operator">site search operator</a> to search within your site. Part of the philosophy behind Ed is to avoid duplicating features that are already easily available in most web ecosystems.</li>
  <li>If you want to allow annotations on your site, consider providing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">via.hypothes.is</code> link. Our sample site can be annotated, for example, using the following link: <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://via.hypothes.is/http://elotroalex.github.io/ed/</code>, which readers can access on the sidebar. To allow annotations on your site you can simply replace our URL with yours. Make sure to visit <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> to learn more.</li>
  <li>Ed includes RDF metadata in the headers that makes it easier for users of Zotero to grab bibliographic information for the site and individual texts. The RDF functionality is not enough to generate a full proper citation. Consider providing proper citation information in your about page or homepage.</li>
  <li>Make sure to deepen your knowledge of the building blocks of Ed: Jekyll, YAML and Liquid. A great list of resources can be found in the blog “<a href="http://jameswillweb.github.io/jekyll-for-designers/resources.html">Jekyll for Web Designers</a>”.</li>

<h2 id="publishing">Publishing</h2>

<h3 id="option-1">Option 1</h3>

<p>Publishing and Ed edition can be done in one of two ways. One way is to host it on a server you rent, own or have access to. Most mortals pay a hosting provider to host their sites. I recommend <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, which is run by scholars for scholars. If you are affiliated with a university, chances are that your institution provides you with a UNIX account and a bit of server space. Since Jekyll generates a full static site for you, that means you can park it there. To do so you need to build the site first. If you have been keeping your eye on your project by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, chances are you have a current built site in your project folder labelled <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code>.</p>

<p>If you don’t already, you can build one easily by using the following Jekyll command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or, again, if you have multiple environments:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using an FTP client like <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>, or <a href="https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/ssh/">SSH on your terminal</a>, you need to push the contents of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder to the folder on your server where you would like your project to exist. Depending on your host provider, you may be able to receive help from the sys admins with this step.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="#a-note-on-your-base-url">note below on base urls</a> to make sure your new links work on your new site.</p>

<h3 id="option-2">Option 2</h3>

<p>The second option is to publish your site for free on GitHub Pages. This option can be a bit more complicated than the first because GitHub is run in <code class="highlighter-rouge">--safe</code> mode, and will normally reject the jekyll-scholar plugin. We can work around this limitation by generating the site before hand and deploying just the site files. I’ve provided a useful <a href="http://blog.sorryapp.com/blogging-with-jekyll/2014/01/31/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html">Rakefile created by Robert Rawlins</a> that allows us to do just that. A Rakefile is a series of Ruby commands that can be run at once. More on running this file below.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to publish on GitHub pages or not, we recommend that you still use git and GitHub to version your edition and make the data available via another channel other than your webpage. This is one of the great advantages of using our system, increasing the chances of survival of your work and opening new audiences for it.</p>

<p>If you do decide to use the GitHub pages option, please make sure to read the <a href="#a-note-on-your-base-url">note below on base urls</a>.</p>

<p>To publish on GitHub pages, you must have a copy of the repository in GitHub. That means you also need an account there. Once you’ve created the repository that you will use, you must link your local repository to the one on GitHub. Notice that because you cloned the original source files from my repository, it will be linked to my repository (to which you don’t have writing privileges) until you do this step. Instructions for changing the remote URL can be found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You also need to create a different git branch called <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> within your local repository for your site. This is the branch that will get published by GitHub. To create and use that branch use the following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git checkout -b gh-pages
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once you are using that branch, you are ready to publish your site using the Rakefile shipped with Ed. To do so use this command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>rake blog:publish
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can now access your site using an address that looks like <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://your-username.github.io/your-project-name</code>. The sample page for Ed, for example, is hosted at <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed">elotroalex.github.io/ed</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-your-base-url">A note on your base url</h3>

<p>When you publish on a subfolder—automatic on GitHub pages—many of your links will break unless you indicate the name of your sub-folder in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code> value in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.html</code> file. In addition, you need to make sure that your site-wide links (your links to your CSS files, for example) are preceded by the `` tag. The base Ed install already uses this system, so you can simply replace the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">/ed</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/your-project-slug</code>.</p>

<p>If on the other hand you are running your site on a root folder, simply erase <code class="highlighter-rouge">/ed</code>, but do make sure to leave the single quotes:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">baseurl</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">'</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<hr />

<p>That should do it. If you have suggestions on how to improve Ed, make sure to leave us a line on <a href="https://github.com/elotroalex/ed/issues">our issues page</a>, or send us a pull request.</p>

<p>Happy editing!</p>
